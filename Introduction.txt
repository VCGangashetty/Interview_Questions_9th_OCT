DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES:

I start my day atleast 30 mins prior to the standup call and look for updates of post working hours of my previous day and prepare for the meeting.
And i update the team on the tickets which i have worked on the previous day and also update them on the tickets which ill be working on current day.
This is how i start my day.
I look for prioritising in the tickets assigned based on its environments as lower or higher and prioritise my tickets myself and work on them.
We quite often get to work on new requirements from the clients to work on new changes which we take them as a new microservices and
i mainly look into building these microservices to managing them and we have roughly 60-65 microservices.
