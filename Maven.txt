1.What are the phases of a Maven Build Life Cycle?

The phases of the Maven Build Life Cycle are as follows,--(VCTPIVID--Validate,compile,test,package, integration test, verify,install, deploy)

• validate - This validates the correctness of the project and ensures all the necessary information is available.

• compile - Used to compile the source code of the project

• test - Used to test the compiled source code with a unit testing framework. This does not require the code to be packaged.

• package - This is used to packaged the compiled code and package it into a distributable format such as a JAR.

• integration-test - Used to run integration test on the packaged file

• verify - run checks on the packaged file is valid and meets the required quality criteria

• install - install the package into the local repository to be used as a dependency in other projects locally

• deploy - used in release environments to deploy copies of the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other projects and developers.

-------------------
2. Name the 3 build life cycles of Maven?

The 3 build lifecycles of Maven are as follows,

a. default or build - This is used to build the application.

b. clean - This is used to clean up the artifacts of the previous builds.

c. site - This is used to generate the site documentation of the project.

--------------------
3. What information does POM contain?

The Project Object Model consists of the following configuration information they are as follows:

• Build profiles

• Developers

• Goals

• Mailing list

• Plugins

• Project dependencies

• Project version


--------------------
4. What is maven?

Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for java based projects also 
it is called as project management tool as it manages the complete build lifecycle.

It helps devops engineers by providing automation around the build phase of the devops lifecycle management.

--------------------
5.What is a Maven Repository?

A Maven repository is the storage place for the 
1.Entire library jar, 
2.Project jars and 
3.Plugins, and 
4.All other project artifacts. This can be used by Maven easily.

--------------------
6.Different maven plugins are:

1. Build Plugins
2. Reporting Plugins

--------------------
7. Different types of maven repo's are:

1. Central,
2. Local and 
3. Remote

--------------------
8.What is a Maven artifact?

A Maven artifact is a file usually a jar that is stored in the Maven repository. 
It consists of an artifact group ID, an artifact ID, and a version string. 
The three uniquely form an artifact. 
The artifacts are called as project dependencies. 
A Maven build produces one or more such artifacts such as Complied jar and source jars.

--------------------
9.What is Build Profile?

Using the build profile we can customize build for the different environments such as development or production. 
The build profile is a set of configuration values required to set or override the default Maven build.

--------------------
10.What are the different types of Build Profiles?

Build profiles are of 3 types they are as follows,

• Per project - defined in the project POM file, pom.xml

• Global - defined in Maven global settings XML file

• Per User - defined in Maven settings XML file

--------------------
11.What are the phases of the site life cycle?

The phases of the site life cycle are as follows,

• pre-site

• site

• post-site

• site-deploy

--------------------
12. What are the phases of the clean life cycle?

The clean life cycle consists of the following phases

• pre-clean

• clean

• post-clean

--------------------
13.Why are the Maven Plugins used?

The Maven plugins are used for the following things,

• compile code files.

• create a jar file.

• create project documentation.

• create project reports.

• create a war file.

• unit testing of code.
